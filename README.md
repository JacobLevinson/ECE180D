Starting the Game:

Instructions:
Welcome to Revers-a-Bomb! This is a two player game where each player is reversing "bombs" along six rows of LED strips. In order to reverse a bomb the players must slap the button on the side of the LED row. This will change the direction of the bomb coming towards you and will now go towards your opponent. You must keep track of all six bombs across the LED strips, before they can blow up on your side. During the game you may use any of the three power-ups below at anytime. First player to lose three lives loses the game and the game is over!

Power-Ups:
- Reverse: Say "Reverse!" three times in order to activate. This power-up reverses all of the bombs on the LED strips.
- Freeze: Say "Freeze!" three times in order to activate. This power-up freezes the bomb of the LED cardboard strip you are in front of.
- Slow: Say "Slow!" three times in order to activate. This power-up slows down the bomb coming towards you in front of the LED cardboard strip you are standing in front of.

Setting Up & Playing:
1. Put on the wristband and the hats. One player will wear the pink hat and one player will wear the neon green hat.
2. Stand in front of the LED strips.
3. Say "Start" or click "Start" to begin the game.
4. Continue playing until one player loses all their three lives.
